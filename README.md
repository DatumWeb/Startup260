# Startup260
This is my Startup Project for CS260 BYU.

## Specification Deliverable

### Elevator Pitch
Most people struggle to learn and understand the complex game of Canasi. This application, ***Baby Canasi***, will help people of all ages begin to understand Canasi and have fun using this much simplified version. Through feedback on scores, leaderboards and winners progression in ***Baby Canasi*** will be enjoyable and trackable. The site will have simple instructions on how to play the game for those who have no idea what it is.

### Sketch
This is a rough sketch of the Intro Page, talking about what Canasi is and how to play Baby Canasi.
