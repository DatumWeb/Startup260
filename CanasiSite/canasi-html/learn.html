            <h2>What is Canasi</h2>
            <p>
                Canasi is a complicated game involving many pieces, memorizing and advanced moves.
                However, we won't be learning this game, but rather what is called "Baby Canasi". This 
                is a MUCH simplified version of the game.
            </p>

            <h2>So what is Baby Canasi</h2>
            <h3>Goal</h3>
            <p>
                Each player has a "Scrivtre". Losing your Scrivtre piece will result in a loss, so it
                is vital you protect yours while trying to eliminate the opponent's Scrivtre. 
            </p>

            <h3>Memorizing</h3>
            <p>
                Just like in Canasi you will still choose your moves in advance and give the opponent an 
                opportunity to look at these. Opposed to the 10 moves in Canasi, Baby Canasi will only do 2 moves.
                 After you declare you must make your declared moves, or you will lose the match.
            </p>

            <h3>The Board and The Pieces</h3>
            <p>
                The board is a 7x7 grid. Each player has 4 pieces, 1 Scrivtre and 3 Silunai. You will choose the location 
                of the starting positions of each piece on turn 1, restricted to the first 3 rows on your side. The movement 
                of pieces is only restricted by a limit of 3 touching tiles, you can not move a piece further than that in a turn. 
                The Silunai can be hit twice before being eliminated, while the Scrivtre can be hit 3 times.
            </p>

            <h3>Gameplay Order</h3>
            <li>1. Decide who goes first.</li>
            <li>2. Declare your first move (the starting location of your pieces) and second move.</li>
            <p>After this the game will fall into a rhythm.</p>
            <li>3. Draw a declared move of your opponent.</li>
            <li>4. Execute your next up declared move.</li>
            <li>5. Declare your move 2 turns from now.</li>
            <li>6. Repeat 3-5 until the Scrivtre is eliminated or someone has performed  a move that was 
                not declared.</li>
        </main>
